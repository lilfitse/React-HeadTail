(Insert a cool image or GIF here — like a slo-mo of the coin flipping, trust me it *hits different*.)

## 🤔 Why This Project?

Because **sometimes you just need to leave your fate to a digital coin** instead of stressing over life decisions.  
Also, making coins spin on a screen is objectively cooler than doing actual work.

**Heads:** You're a legend.  
**Tails:** You're still a legend.

Win-win, baby.
